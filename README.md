# Analysis-on-Waiters-Tips
After my cousin suggested I got a job as a waiter, I became curious on how tips varied among different customers. I pulled a dataset of different customers and their correlated tips in order to find trends and relationships between characteristics and the amount tipped. I explored different graphs and models to concluide that tips have a linear relationship with a dining group's size and the total bill paid.
